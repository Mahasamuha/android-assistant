# Phone Assistant — Plan (draft)

Status: phases 1–3 done (`docs/phase1-notes.md`, `docs/phase2-notes.md`, `docs/phase3-notes.md`); the server side is deployed on the home server, and the app is in daily use on the Pixel 8. Built since phase 3: navigation (2026-10-22), timers and alarms (2026-10-23). Planned next in §5a: search results list, music, reminders.

## 1. Goal

A personal voice assistant on Android, roughly what Google Assistant used to be, built for one user and sideloaded:

- Ask questions by voice and get spoken answers.
- Take actions on the phone: calls, texts, launch apps, timers, settings.
- Optionally understand what's on screen ("reply to this", "add this to my calendar").
- Use a hosted LLM API with spend that is tracked and capped.

Non-goals for now: self-hosted model, Play Store distribution, multi-user, iOS.

## 2. Decisions made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Name: Samu | The assistant's name (2026-10-22): the app label, how it refers to itself (base system prompt), and the panel's status line ("SAMU · LISTENING…"). Bylines and any about text use "Samu by Mahasamuha"; Mahasamuha is the brand and design system. |
| Platform: Pixel 8 on Android 17 (build CP3A.260905.009) | iOS doesn't allow third-party always-on mic or cross-app control. Target and test against Android 17 (API 37). Pixel 8 has Google's on-device speech recognition and a configurable power-button assistant gesture; it's within Google's 7-year update window. |
| App shell: native app, not HA Companion | Avoid being bound to another project's design choices; HA Assist is built around home automation, not a general phone assistant. HA Companion stays a possible fallback if the native build stalls. |
| Invocation: gesture and manual first | Phone battery is aging. A CPU-based wake word costs a lot of battery (HA measured roughly 1% → 15% per day). |
| Wake word path kept open, not built | A trigger seam in the design so it can be added later (Porcupine on CPU, or an official DSP API if one ever reaches US builds). |
| Model: hosted API, not self-hosted | Self-hosting isn't worth it for this; spend tracking is the requirement. |
| Network path: public HTTPS with OAuth from day one; no tunnel | Proton VPN is almost always on, and Android allows only one active VPN at a time, so a WireGuard/Tailscale tunnel would conflict. Public HTTPS + OAuth also matches what a VPS deployment would need. |
| LLM gateway: Bifrost (OSS, Apache 2.0), home server initially, configurable host | Virtual keys with budgets, rate limits, and cost tracking are in the free tier. Lighter than LiteLLM. Stays private behind the auth gateway. |
| Token validation: small custom auth gateway in front of Bifrost | Bifrost's OIDC/JWT support is Enterprise-only (unpublished pricing); LiteLLM's is too (reportedly ~$250/mo+). A separate gateway keeps the LLM gateway off the internet and is independent of which LLM gateway sits behind it. |
| Gateway pair is an isolated, replaceable unit | The app only sees an OpenAI-compatible base URL plus an OAuth issuer. Swapping Bifrost for LiteLLM (or anything else) touches only the gateway's upstream config. |
| v1 requires the phone to be unlocked before calling the LLM | One chunk at a time. Lock-screen use may be added later. |
| LLM provider: Anthropic | Existing account. Start with a small, fast model; latency matters more than capability for v1. Confirm Bifrost's Anthropic tool-calling translation in phase 2, including the server-side web search tool (§6). Model: Haiku 5.5 (`claude-haiku-5-5`); verified 2026-10-20 that it runs the basic web search tool (`web_search_20250305`) directly. |
| Unreachable server: fail cleanly in v1 | Spoken error, no provider key on the phone. App config holds endpoints as a list so a fallback URL/host can be added in v.next without code changes. |
| STT: on-device, behind a replaceable interface | Free, private, no extra round trip. An API implementation can be swapped in if accuracy (especially on contact names) disappoints. No silent fallback to the platform's default recognizer (which may send audio off the phone): without on-device recognition the assistant says so. |
| Confirmation policy for side effects | **Texts:** always read back recipient and body; send only after confirmation. **Calls:** always announce "Calling <name>, <number type>"; if the contact match is high-confidence, proceed without waiting; if ambiguous (multiple matches or numbers), ask first. Once the session has read outside content (web search, weather), every call asks first, since that content could carry injected instructions. An announced call dials the contact's saved number, never the model's text. **Timers and alarms:** set at once and reported ("Timer, 10 minutes"), with nothing to cancel, even after outside content: they are harmless and easy to undo, and waiting for the announcement lost them when the panel was dismissed mid-sentence (2026-10-23). Numbers must be plain (digits, `+`, separators); star codes, pauses and letters are rejected. **Confirming:** voice or tap, always both available. |
| Memory: per invocation in v1 | Context lives while the session panel is open (enough for "which Sam?" follow-ups), then is discarded. The intent is no persistent record on the phone of what was said, searched or done: session state lives only in memory, never on disk, so holding it for a short time after the panel closes is consistent with this (see §6). Persistent notes (e.g., aliases, preferred numbers) are a later feature. |
| Logging: configurable on the server | Cost/usage data always kept. Request/response bodies: configurable retention (start with short retention). Plus a server-side debug toggle that turns on full logging and automatically turns itself off after ~30 minutes, for reproducing issues. Controlled on the server, not the app. Likely implemented in the auth gateway (it sees every request) so it doesn't depend on Bifrost's logging features; Bifrost keeps cost data. |
| Phone stack: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose | The assistant role, session, and call/SMS/contacts APIs are all native; no cross-platform layer since iOS is permanently out of scope. Compose for the panel UI. |
| UI: the Mahasamuha design system | Paper and ink palette, Geist and Geist Mono (bundled variable fonts, OFL, so no downloadable-fonts dependency), ink primary and ghost buttons, indigo/tint chat bubbles, mono uppercase labels, the node mark drawn from its own geometry. Light follows the paper theme; system dark mode uses the flat-ink variant. Tokens and components live in `app/.../ui/`. |
| Token lifetimes | Access token ~10 minutes; refresh token ~60 days, rotated on use (sliding). Refresh token encrypted with a hardware-backed Android Keystore key. Configured in Authentik's provider settings. |
| Auth gateway implementation | TypeScript on Node (strict mode, pnpm); Bun may be explored later since the code is the same. Streams responses through without buffering (SSE pass-through), forwarding only `content-type` from upstream; Bifrost runs with `extra_fields_placement: "headers"` so its metadata (including provider org/workspace IDs) never enters response bodies. Stateless apart from the debug-logging toggle and an in-memory rate limit (both reset on restart, which is acceptable). Minimal public surface: an explicit route allowlist (today `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /mcp`, and `GET /healthz`; `POST /v1/chat/completions` was removed once the app moved to Responses), every route except health requiring a valid token, everything else 404. New routes are added deliberately and recorded here. |
| LLM endpoint: OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`) | Replaces chat completions (phase 3). Chat completions flattens Claude's answer blocks into one string and drops search results, so quoted source text was read aloud and follow-ups "retracted" correct figures they could no longer see. Responses returns typed items: searches (`web_search_call`) go back in history so follow-ups see them, citations are annotations, phone tools are `function_call` / `function_call_output`. Still an OpenAI-standard format, so the gateway pair stays replaceable. Reasoning items are dropped from history (Bifrost loses the thinking signatures). Cost: about $0.0016 per later turn per kept search; full history is kept (sessions are 5–7 turns). Bifrost logs cost and budget on this route, and its bodies carry no `extra_fields`. Details: `docs/phase3-notes.md`. |
| Search sources in the panel | A search answer's bubble gets a small "↗ N" pill on its tail corner, like a chat reaction; tapping it lists the pages the search found, and tapping one opens it in the browser and closes the panel, like a search result (§5a). (Today the panel stays open behind the browser; change planned 2026-10-22, not built.) Spoken answers stay free of sources. Sources are the pages our `web_search` returned for that turn, shown on the answer bubble that follows the search. (With Anthropic's search they came from citation events; Anthropic requires citations alongside search output shown to end users.) |
| Search results list: `search-results` skill with a local `show_search_results` tool (planned 2026-10-22, not built) | "Search for …" / "show me results for …" asks for pages, not an answer, which the sources pill doesn't cover (it only appears on an answer). A local read-only tool (`readOnlyHint`, `openWorldHint`) calls the remote `web_search` through the MCP client and renders the pages in the panel as tappable rows; a tap opens the page in the browser. The model gets back only a count and the titles and never supplies URLs, so injected page text can't choose what is shown or opened. Results are not read aloud. Details in §5a. |
| Music: Symfonium driven by its broadcast API, names resolved on the Plex server (2026-10-23) | Spikes (§6) ruled out the alternatives: Plexamp's play-from-search mismatches albums and tracks, its media browser refuses Samu, and starting it from the Plex server only works on home Wi-Fi. Symfonium reads the Plex library directly (no re-indexing), plays exactly named items, mixes, genres and playlists, casts to Sonos and Google Cast, and its API is local to the phone. Costs: a paid closed-source player replacing Plexamp, and Plex credentials on the MCP server for the lookup. |
| Web search: our own `web_search` tool, Brave Search API behind the MCP server (§4b step 4) | Replaces Anthropic's server-side search (phases 2–3), which read verbatim source fragments aloud (Claude's cited answer blocks) and was the one provider-specific piece of the request. Brave: own index, sold for AI answers, $5 per 1,000 searches with $5 monthly credit; Bing's API is retired, Google's Custom Search closed to new customers, and self-hosted meta-search (SearXNG) scrapes engines against their terms. The `llm/context` endpoint returns extracted page text; the server sends the top 8 pages in a 24,000-character budget. In a spike it answered market closes, sports and news correctly with no quoted fragments, as fast as Anthropic's search despite the extra model round, at half the per-search price. No fallback: if the MCP server or Brave is down, there is no search. Key only in `deploy/.env`. Details: `docs/phase3-notes.md`. |
| Thinking: `reasoning_effort: "low"` | Thinking off (the phase 2 choice, for speed) let the model narrate its reasoning aloud and invent options despite prompt rules. Low effort keeps reasoning in an unspoken step; measured cost about 0.5–2 s before the first word on plain and search answers, none on tool-call turns (`docs/phase3-notes.md`). Supersedes "thinking off" in the web search row. |
| Approximate location (coarse permission, city level) | The phone resolves a coarse fix to city/region/country while the user is speaking and passes it to the prompt, which the model uses for weather and puts in search queries when location matters. Without it, location-dependent questions need the city spoken. Coordinates leave the phone only rounded, for the weather tool. |
| Weather: Pirate Weather on the server, Open-Meteo on the phone as fallback | The user already pays for Pirate Weather; it adds official alerts (NWS in the US) and minute-by-minute rain for the next hour, which Open-Meteo lacks. A remote `get_weather` on the MCP server (registered only when its key is set) replaces the phone's by name, with the same inputs (`place`, `day`, `end_day`) and output shape plus `alerts` and `next_hour`; `place` is required, since the server doesn't know where the phone is, so city-level location travels as a name and coordinates no longer leave the phone. The phone's Open-Meteo tool stays behind it and answers on any remote failure. Key in `deploy/.env`, sent in a header so it never appears in a URL. |
| Weather via a tool, not web search | Verified 2026-10-20: web search returns indexed snapshots of weather pages, often days old, and prompting can't fix stale data (a retry instruction made answers confidently wrong). A `get_weather` tool runs on the phone against Open-Meteo (no key). The swap point is the tool, not a provider interface: a keyed provider such as Pirate Weather becomes a remote `get_weather` that overrides the local one (§4b), with its key server-side. This pulls the phase 3 tool registry forward. |
| MCP client on the phone: our own, not the Kotlin SDK | The official Kotlin MCP SDK (0.15.0) roughly doubles the release APK (3.1 MB → 5.3 MB with R8 shrinking it, 10.0 MB without): it implements the whole spec for every platform (about 600 schema classes with generated serializers, Ktor, kotlinx-io, every transport). Our server is stateless with plain-JSON responses, so the phone needs only `tools/list` and `tools/call` as one POST each (no `initialize`: a stateless server keeps nothing between requests; the protocol version travels in the `mcp-protocol-version` header). About 150 lines with `HttpURLConnection` and `org.json`, like the chat client. Revisit if the phone needs more of MCP. |
| Tools and skills (§4b) | Tools shaped like MCP tool definitions (JSON Schema input, side-effect annotations); skills in the Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format with our `delivery` and `tools` fields. Both are existing standards, so nothing bespoke to maintain or explain. Confirmation is enforced by per-tool policy in phone code, never by skill text. Skills always loaded for now; progressive disclosure when they grow. |
| Confirmation mechanics (§4b) | Action tools prepare, the registry confirms, then performs, so no tool can skip the step. Ask (read back, wait for yes), Announce (say it, go ahead unless cancelled), or Report (do it at once and say it; timers and alarms). Yes/no is decided on the phone by a strict whole-utterance list, not by the model; anything else goes back to the model as `not_confirmed` with what the user said, which lets "no, change it to…" revise the action. Read-back text comes from the resolved arguments, not the model. |
| Hybrid delivery via an MCP server behind the gateway (§4b) | Some things must run on the phone (SMS), some must run on the server (keyed APIs like Pirate Weather). An MCP server on the private network serves remote tools and draft skills; the phone stays the single owner of the tool loop. Chosen over a bespoke gateway route (non-standard) and Bifrost's MCP integration (splits the loop, ties tools to Bifrost). Adds `/mcp` to the gateway allowlist when step 4 is built. |
| Server images: gateway and MCP published to Docker Hub by GitHub Actions | The home server pulls `mahasamuha/samu-gateway` and `mahasamuha/samu-mcp` and needs only `deploy/`, not a checkout or a build toolchain. Images hold no configuration (all env), are smoke-tested before each push, and are tagged `latest` and `sha-<commit>` for pinning and rollback. `compose.build.yaml` builds from source for development. |
| v1 capabilities (see §5a) | General Q&A with short spoken answers, including live web lookups; weather; contact lookup + phone call; SMS. |

## 3. Platform constraints (from research, Oct 2026)

- **Default assistant role is still available.** Researched on Android 16; Android 17's published behavior changes don't touch the assistant role or `VoiceInteractionService`. Third-party apps (ChatGPT, Perplexity) can hold it. **Phase 1 finding:** the headset button does not route through the role; it fires `ACTION_WEB_SEARCH`/`VOICE_SEARCH_HANDS_FREE` activity intents, so headset support needs a separate trampoline activity (see `docs/phase1-notes.md`). Holding it gives power-button long-press, corner swipe, lock-screen invocation, and optional screen context (`AssistStructure` + screenshot). Phase 1 confirms this on the actual phone.
- **The DSP (low-power hotword chip) path is closed to third parties.** The permissions are privileged-only and `adb` can't grant them. Root or a custom ROM gets the permissions, but loading a custom model into the DSP is vendor-specific and largely undocumented.
- **EU DMA decision (16 Jul 2026)** requires Google to open hotword detection, screen automation, App Functions, etc. to rival assistants. Deadlines: Android 18 by Aug 2027, concurrent hotwords in Android 19 by Aug 2028. It is EU-scoped, so whether US builds get it is unknown. Plan doesn't depend on it.
- **Sideloading removes Play policy limits.** `READ_CONTACTS`, `CALL_PHONE`, and `SEND_SMS` are normal runtime permissions for a personally installed app.
- **Android 17 changes that touch this app:**
  - Background audio hardening: a lifecycle condition, not a permission. Audio playback/focus/volume calls fail silently when the app isn't visible or running a foreground service; apps targeting API 37 need that foreground service to have while-in-use capabilities, which it gets if started while the app is visible. **Verified in phase 1 (Pixel 6a, Android 17):** platform `TextToSpeech` keeps speaking after the panel closes with no foreground service. The TTS engine plays the audio in its own process, and the assistant's process stays bound at foreground-service level with full capabilities while it holds the role. No foreground service is planned for on-device TTS. Recheck if audio is ever played in our own process (e.g. a cloud TTS through `AudioTrack`).
  - Contacts provider: some account columns removed from `ContactsContract.Data` (read from `RawContacts` instead); stricter SQL on unpermissioned queries. Minor for name/number lookup.
  - Background activity launch restrictions extended to `IntentSender`; launching the dialer or Signal must happen while the session is visible.
  - `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` permission required for LAN access when targeting API 37. Not needed while the gateway is reached over public HTTPS.
  - SMS OTP delay applies to reading SMS, not sending. Not relevant.
  - **Observed (Pixel 6a, Android 17):** the token key (`setUnlockedDeviceRequired`) can refuse to decrypt while the screen shows unlocked. The phone had started to lock and was woken within the grace period without a fingerprint or PIN; the Keystore still treated it as locked. A real unlock fixes it. The app says so instead of "unlock your phone".
- **Developer verification (sideloading).** Global enforcement on certified devices in 2027 (four countries from 30 Sep 2026). **ADB installs are exempt**, so installing/updating from a computer (Android Studio uses ADB) needs no registration. Installing without a computer would need either the one-time "advanced flow" (developer mode, 24-hour wait, then unverified installs allowed with a warning) or a free limited distribution account (no ID, up to 20 devices). Keep the signing key backed up: registration ties package names to signing keys.
- **LLM gateway auth is paywalled across the board.** LiteLLM: native JWT is Enterprise; a free custom-auth Python hook exists but mapping to virtual keys is Enterprise. Bifrost: OSS inbound auth is username/password or none; OIDC/SAML and upstream-proxy JWT are Enterprise; custom auth would mean a Go plugin compiled into a custom build. Hence the separate auth gateway.
- **Signal has no public API for other apps to send messages.** Considered for v1 and dropped. If revisited: one-tap handoff to Signal's chat, or signal-cli (unofficial) as a linked device on the server. Replying to an incoming message through its notification's Reply action is a third route (notification access, §6).

## 4. Architecture

```
Phone
  Trigger (gesture / power / headset / tile)
    → Session (panel UI)
    → STT (speech-to-text)
    → HTTPS + OAuth bearer token
                │
                ▼
Server (home server to start; isolated, replaceable unit)
  Reverse proxy (TLS)
    → Auth gateway (TypeScript)
        - validate Authentik JWT (JWKS signature, iss, aud, exp)
        - attach the phone's Bifrost virtual key
        - rate-limit
    → Bifrost (private network only)
        - virtual key → budget, rate limits, model allowlist
        - cost tracking / logs
    → LLM provider
                │
                ▼
Phone
  ←→ Tool executors (tool calls returned by the LLM run on the phone)
  → TTS (text-to-speech)
```

### Auth flow

- **Identity provider:** Authentik.
- **Phone client:** a statically registered public client in Authentik (no DCR needed for a single known app). Authorization code + PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) via a browser custom tab, likely using the AppAuth-Android library.
- **Tokens on the phone:** access token short-lived; refresh token stored encrypted with an Android Keystore key, so a gesture invocation can silently refresh without a login prompt. v1 only uses them while the phone is unlocked.
- **Validation:** the auth gateway checks the JWT signature against Authentik's JWKS, plus issuer, audience, and expiry. The audience is the assistant provider's client ID, checked as a single exact string (array audiences rejected, as in the asterism-proxy design); with Authentik's per-provider issuer, a dedicated provider gives the same isolation as a per-resource audience. On success it forwards to Bifrost with the virtual key attached. Bifrost is never reachable from outside.
- **What the app is configured with:** issuer URL, client ID, gateway base URL. No secrets.
- **What the gateway is configured with:** issuer/JWKS URL, expected audience, upstream (Bifrost) URL, virtual key (env var). Upstream URL is the only thing that changes if Bifrost is swapped.

Components and options:

| Component | Choice | Alternatives | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| App shell | Native app holding the assistant role | — | Decided |
| LLM gateway / spend tracking | Bifrost OSS; virtual key with budget for the phone | LiteLLM (custom-auth hook), others | Decided (replaceable) |
| Token validation | Custom TypeScript auth gateway | oauth2-proxy; MCP auth proxy gateway mode | Decided |
| Network path | Public HTTPS + OAuth (Authentik) | — | Decided |
| LLM provider | Anthropic (existing account), small fast model by default | OpenAI; OpenRouter as upstream | Decided (replaceable via Bifrost) |
| STT | On-device `SpeechRecognizer` behind an STT interface | Whisper / Deepgram API (via the gateway) | Decided (replaceable) |
| TTS | Android `TextToSpeech` | OpenAI / ElevenLabs API | Default to on-device |
| Actions | Intents + direct APIs (see §5a) | AccessibilityService for UI driving (fragile) | Intents first; accessibility only if needed |
| Screen context | `onHandleAssist` → send text summary to LLM | — | Later phase |

### 4b. Tools and skills

Two kinds of capability, borrowed from existing standards rather than invented: **tools** (code, shaped like MCP tool definitions) and **skills** (instructions, in the Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format). The model sees one tool list and one set of skill instructions, wherever each piece runs or comes from.

**Tools** are functions the model can call.

- Spec follows the MCP tool shape: `name`, `description`, `inputSchema` (JSON Schema), and annotations `title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`. Unset annotations take MCP's defaults (not read-only, destructive, not idempotent, open-world), so an unannotated tool is treated as having side effects. Annotations stay on the phone; the chat request carries only name, description, and schema.
- Local tools are registered per session, only when their permission is granted (contacts, SMS), so a skill that needs a missing one drops out with them.
- Two kinds of local tool. **Read-only tools** (`readOnlyHint: true`, e.g. `get_weather`) just run. **Action tools** split into *prepare* (validate and resolve the arguments, return a pending action) and *perform*. The registry rejects a tool whose kind contradicts its `readOnlyHint`.
- **Local tools** run on the phone (contacts, calls, SMS, weather today). **Remote tools** run on the server, for anything that needs a key or server resources (e.g. Pirate Weather). The phone owns the tool loop for both, so the model can't tell them apart.
- **Confirmation is enforced in phone code, never by skill or prompt text.** Each local tool declares its policy: SMS always confirms; a call is announced and confirms only when the contact match is ambiguous or the session has read outside content (§2); read-only tools never confirm. A remote tool confirms unless the server marks it `readOnlyHint` (so search doesn't ask every time). Nothing a skill says can weaken this.
- **Why the phone trusts a remote tool's `readOnlyHint`.** A remote tool runs on the server; confirming on the phone only decides whether the phone sends the request. Everything with a side effect on the phone (contacts, SMS, calls) is a local tool that a remote one can't replace (`allowRemote`, see Discovery), so a wrong hint can't cause a phone-side action. A compromised server can act on its own end whatever the phone confirms. What's left is a server bug that marks an effectful tool read-only, which then runs unasked; accepted.
- **Read-back for remote action tools (planned; build with the first one).** Today the phone asks a generic "Run <title> with <argument> <value>…?". The plan: the server sends a confirmation template with the tool definition, in the MCP `_meta` field (e.g. `"Add {item} to the shopping list?"`), and the phone fills it from the actual arguments, so the wording comes from the server and the values from what will really be sent. It is never written by the model; steering the model's own phrasing through the tool description would break the read-back rule above. Every remote action's confirmation goes through one phone-side preprocessor: arguments the template doesn't use are appended so nothing is hidden, and with no template the phone still asks, listing every argument and opening with a spoken warning that the tool has no confirmation text set up. The warning is meant to be noticeable enough that a misconfigured tool gets fixed rather than tolerated.
- **Confirmation flow.** A pending action carries one of three confirmations, and the registry, not the tool, carries it out:
  - *Ask* (SMS, ambiguous calls): the panel shows the prompt with Confirm and Cancel, speaks it, then listens. Voice or tap, whichever comes first. A spoken reply confirms only if the whole utterance is a yes ("yes", "send it", "go ahead"…), judged on the phone by a fixed list, not by the model.
  - *Announce* (high-confidence calls): the panel shows the text with Cancel, speaks it in full, then performs. Once a read-only tool with `openWorldHint` has run in the session (web search, weather), the registry turns every Announce into an Ask with the tool's question form ("Call Mom, mobile?") for the rest of the session.
  - *Report* (timers, alarms): performs at once and speaks the text while it happens; no card and nothing to cancel. Stays a report after outside content. The panel closes only once the line has been spoken.
  - An action that closes the panel (call, navigation, timer, alarm) also ends the turn, so the model gets no further round: once the panel waited for speech, the model's follow-up ("Your bread alarm is set…") was spoken after the report (2026-10-23).
  - The prompt text is built by phone code from the resolved arguments, never from the model's text, so the user confirms what will actually happen.
  - Anything other than a yes (no, silence, "no, say ten minutes") returns `{"status": "not_confirmed", "user_said": …}` to the model, which can then revise and call again (confirmed again). The base prompt tells the model the phone confirms, so it calls send/call tools directly instead of asking first.
  - Before performing, the phone checks it is still unlocked (§2).
  - Several tool calls in one response are confirmed one at a time.
- **Discovery (step 4):** at session start, while the user is still speaking, the phone fetches the remote tool list (`tools/list`) and draft skills from the MCP server, in parallel like location, so it adds no delay. That session's registry is the local tools plus the remote ones; **a remote tool overrides a local tool with the same name only if the local tool opts in** (`allowRemote`, today only `get_weather`); otherwise the remote one is dropped, so the server can't replace a tool that reads contacts or acts on the phone. A local tool's name stays reserved even in a session where its permission is off. The model learns of tools only through the definitions sent with each request, so a newly deployed remote tool appears in the next session without an app update, and skills that reference it by name don't change. If the server is slow or down, the last fetched list (cached in memory on the phone) or the local tools alone are used. If a remote tool fails mid-session and a read-only local tool has the same name, the phone falls back to it (e.g. remote Pirate Weather fails → local Open-Meteo answers).
- Web search is a remote tool (`web_search` on the MCP server, backed by Brave), not the provider's server-side search.

**Skills** are instruction bundles.

- A folder with a `SKILL.md`: YAML frontmatter, then plain instructions. Frontmatter: `name`, `description` (what it's for and when to use it), plus two fields of ours: `delivery` (`app` or `server`) and `tools` (tool names it relies on; omit for instruction-only skills).
- Example: *weather* bundles `get_weather` with how to phrase answers ("one current reading, 'a low around…'"); *texting* carries how to read back an SMS; a *kitchen conversions* skill would be instructions only.
- Domain rules live in skills, so the base system prompt stays generic: voice style, brevity, no reasoning narration, and how to behave around tools and actions (nothing said before an action, the phone confirms, no claiming success before the result, declined actions, fresh lookups). Rules that first appear in one skill move to the base prompt once they apply to every tool.
- **Loading: always loaded for now.** Every active skill's full text is appended to the system prompt, sorted by name so the prompt stays byte-stable for caching. A skill whose tools aren't available this session (permission off, server unreachable) is left out. Move to progressive disclosure (the prompt lists each skill's name and description, and a `load_skill` tool returns the body) when there are roughly ten or more skills or their text gets long; the `SKILL.md` format doesn't change.

**Where skills come from: one source, two delivery paths.**

- Source of truth is `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the repo.
- `delivery: app` skills are bundled into the APK at build time. `delivery: server` skills are drafts, served live by the server (below), so they can change without an app rebuild.
- Promoting a draft is changing `delivery: server` to `app` and rebuilding; the text doesn't move.
- On the phone: bundled skills load first, then server skills; a server skill with the same name overrides the bundled one, so an existing skill can be revised as a draft. Server skills and the remote tool list are cached on the phone, used immediately, and refreshed in the background for the next session. Fetching never delays a turn; with the server down, bundled skills and the cache still work.

**Server side: an MCP server behind the gateway.**

- A small MCP server (TypeScript, Streamable HTTP, stateless) on the private network next to Bifrost, holding the keys its tools need in env. It serves remote tools (`tools/list`, `tools/call`) and draft skills as resources (`skill://<name>`), read from the deployed `skills/` directory.
- The gateway adds `/mcp` to its route allowlist (§2), with the same token check and rate limit, forwarding without any key from the phone. It's a standard protocol, so the same server also works from other MCP clients.
- Not Bifrost's MCP integration: that would run part of the tool loop inside the LLM gateway and tie tools to Bifrost (against the replaceable-unit design).

**Rollout**, each step usable on its own:

1. Bundled skills: `skills/` in the repo, the app build copies `delivery: app` skills into assets, prompt assembly, and weather's rules move from the base prompt into `skills/weather`. No server change.
2. Tool spec: annotations and per-tool confirmation policy in the registry, plus the confirmation flow in the panel (voice or tap). Needed before anything sends or calls. Built; first exercised on the phone by step 3's SMS tool.
3. Phase 3's local tools on top: `find_contact`, call, SMS, with their skills. `find_contact` returns only the matched contacts' names and numbers; `send_sms(phone_number, message)` takes a number from it, and its read-back names the recipient from the phone's own reverse lookup of that number. When the lookup finds a contact, the text goes to (or the call dials) that contact's saved number, not the model's text, so what the user hears is what happens; on the test phone the lookup did not match a number with a different area code or only the last 7 digits (the digits were read back instead), and matches with different saved numbers fall back to reading the digits. A text's read-back drops control and invisible characters and is capped at 320 characters. `place_call(phone_number, contact_name)` is announced only when the phone's contacts agree: the name matches exactly one contact, the number is one of its numbers, and no other number of that contact has the same type; otherwise it asks first. The model still does the "which Sam?" question; this is the backstop. Calls go through `TelecomManager.placeCall`, not an `ACTION_CALL` activity: on the test phone Zoom also handles `ACTION_CALL`, so the intent resolved to a chooser that opened behind the panel. The panel closes once the call is placed. Emergency numbers open the default dialer prefilled (`ACTION_DIAL`), since apps can't place them. Built: `find_contact`, `send_sms` with the `texting` skill (tested on device), and `place_call` with the `calling` skill (tested on device: announce-and-dial for a certain match, "which one?" for different numbers, panel closes on the call screen).
4. Server half: the MCP server, the gateway's `/mcp` route, and an MCP client on the phone. Then remote tools (e.g. a Pirate Weather `get_weather`) and draft skills. Built: the server (`mcp/`) with `web_search`, the `/mcp` route, and the phone's client and remote tool loading. Draft skills come when there is a draft to serve.

## 5. Phases

1. **Prove invocation.** App holds the assistant role on the Android 17 phone; gesture opens a panel.
2. **Auth + voice round trip.** Authentik client; auth gateway + Bifrost on the home server with a budgeted virtual key. App signs in once, then STT → LLM → TTS with no tools. Verify budget enforcement and cost logging. Covers v1 capability 1.
3. **Actions.** Tools and skills per §4b, rollout steps 1–3: bundled skills, the tool spec with confirmation, then the v1 tools (§5a). Step 4 (server-side tools and draft skills via MCP) follows when a server tool is needed. (The tool loop and the weather tool were pulled forward into phase 2.)
4. **Screen context.** Feed on-screen text to the LLM when invoked.
5. **Gaps only.** AccessibilityService UI driving, wake word, HA integration, lock-screen use — each only if earlier phases leave a real need.

Phases 1 and the server half of 2 are independent and can be done in either order.

Exit criterion per phase: used daily for a week without wanting to go back to the previous phase's workaround.

### 5a. v1 capabilities

| Capability | Example | Mechanism | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| General Q&A, spoken, with live web lookups | "How many grams in a cup of sugar?" / "What's the weather in Boston?" | LLM, plus our `web_search` tool (Brave, through the MCP server) when the answer depends on current information ($0.005 per search plus result tokens; adds a few seconds). System prompt requires short, plain-text, speakable answers (no markdown, lists, or URLs; numbers and units written to be read aloud); citations are not read aloud. | — |
| Weather | "What's the weather tonight?" / "Any weather alerts?" | `get_weather` on the MCP server, backed by Pirate Weather (adds official alerts and next-hour rain): the model passes the place (named, or the user's city from the context), the server geocodes it. If the server or Pirate Weather fails, the phone's Open-Meteo `get_weather` answers instead (coordinates rounded to about 10 km). | `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` (optional; otherwise the user names the place) |
| Contact lookup | "Call Mom" → resolve "Mom" | `ContactsContract` query on the phone, exposed to the LLM as a `find_contact` tool. When nothing matches (speech recognition often misspells uncommon names), a sound-alike search over the contact names on the phone (a rough phonetic key plus Jaro-Winkler) offers up to three candidates marked approximate, and the model asks "did you mean …" before acting; only those candidates leave the phone. A nickname spelled the way the recognizer writes a name is the reliable fix for one that keeps failing. High confidence = exactly one contact match with one number of the requested type; anything else is ambiguous and the assistant asks back. | `READ_CONTACTS` |
| Search results (planned) | "Search for ramen places in Springfield" / "Show me results for Pixel 8 battery replacement" | Local `show_search_results(query)` calls the remote `web_search` and shows its pages as a list in the panel (title and domain per row). A tap opens the page in the default browser (`ACTION_VIEW`, `http`/`https` only, launched while the session is visible). Samu speaks one short line ("Here's what I found for …"); the panel doesn't close on its own after a search (verified 2026-10-22), so the list stays up. Tapping a result launches the browser and then closes the panel, as a placed call does (launch first, while the session is still visible). Paired with the `search-results` skill (`delivery: app`, `tools: [show_search_results]`), which tells the model to use it when the user asks to search or to see results, and to answer normally (with `web_search`) when they ask a question. Same cost as a search. | — |
| Phone call | "Call Mom on her mobile" | `ACTION_CALL` intent with the resolved number, launched while the session is visible. | `CALL_PHONE` |
| SMS | "Text Sam I'm running late" | `SmsManager` send, after spoken/visual confirmation of recipient and body. | `SEND_SMS` |
| Navigation | "Navigate to Costco" / "Navigate home with Google Maps" / "Navigate to Mom's" | Local `navigate` action tool, announced: a Waze (default) or Google Maps navigation intent, launched while the session is visible. The maps app resolves a named place itself (usually the nearest match); Samu doesn't ask "which one" (that would need a places API). "home" and "work" are addresses saved on the setup screen, and a contact's address comes from Contacts by exact name; the phone substitutes both, so the model never sees an address. With device location off, Samu says so and a transparent activity shows Play services' one-tap "turn on location" dialog, then opens the maps app (neither maps app handles location being off well; `play-services-location` is used only for this). | `READ_CONTACTS` (contact addresses only) |
| Timer | "Set a timer for 10 minutes" / "Pasta timer, 8 minutes" | Local `set_timer(duration_seconds, label?)` action tool, set at once and reported ("Timer, 10 minutes"; §2): `AlarmClock.ACTION_SET_TIMER` with `EXTRA_SKIP_UI` to the Clock app, launched while the session is visible; the panel closes once the line has been spoken. The model passes a duration in seconds, never clock text; the announcement is built from it. With the `clock` skill (phrasing, label only when given). | `SET_ALARM` (normal permission) |
| Alarm | "Wake me up at 6:30" / "Alarm at 7 on weekdays" | Local `set_alarm(hour, minute, days?, label?)` action tool, set at once and reported ("Alarm, 6:30 AM tomorrow", "Alarm, 7 AM, weekdays"): `AlarmClock.ACTION_SET_ALARM` with `EXTRA_SKIP_UI`; the panel closes once the line has been spoken. Hour is 24-hour. When the user doesn't say AM or PM, the model infers it when obvious ("wake me up" is morning; otherwise the next time that hour comes up within 12 hours, when that clearly fits) and asks only when it is genuinely unclear (decided 2026-10-23). The announcement always says AM or PM, and "today" or "tomorrow" for a one-time alarm, so a wrong guess is heard. Shares the `clock` skill. Cancelling or listing alarms is out of scope: `AlarmClock` can dismiss but not enumerate, so "cancel my 6:30" would rely on the Clock app's own matching. | `SET_ALARM` |
| Music | "Play OK Computer" / "Play some music" / "Play some classical in the office" / "Pause" / "Turn it up" | Local `play_music(kind, name?, artist?, speaker?)` action tool, set at once and reported ("Playing OK Computer by Radiohead"; §2), driving Symfonium through its documented broadcast API on the phone, so it works on any network. Symfonium matches names exactly and silently ignores unknown ones, so the phone first resolves the request to the library's exact names with `music_find`, a remote tool on the MCP server that searches the Plex server (kept out of the model's tool list: a local tool can declare remote tools it calls itself); no match returns the closest names for a "did you mean". Kinds: album, song, artist, playlist, genre (shuffled), mix (Symfonium's song mix, for "play some music" / "shuffle my library"). Speakers are discovered on home Wi-Fi when named: Sonos groups through mDNS and the Sonos zone topology (Symfonium's ID is the group coordinator + `_MR`), Google Cast devices through mDNS (their `id`); the model sees only names. Local `music_control(action)`: play, pause, next, previous, volume, move to a speaker, reported the same way. With the `music` skill. Requires Symfonium (paid, closed source) signed in to the Plex server (§6). | `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` (normal) |
| Reminder (planned) | "Remind me at 5 to call the plumber" / "Remind me tomorrow morning to move the car" | Local `set_reminder(when, text)` action tool, announced with the time and the text read back from the resolved arguments. Backend undecided (§6). | Depends on backend |

Privacy note: contact lookup happens on the phone; only the matched name and number (not the address book) go to the LLM, and only when a tool call asks for them.

**Future expansion (not planned):** additional tools and skills such as adding calendar events. §4b makes these additive: a skill, plus a local or remote tool if it needs one.

**Home Assistant (requested 2026-10-22, low priority):** control and status of the home through the existing Home Assistant instance. Waits on the home automation setup itself, which is still thin. Sketch, to firm up when it's picked up:

- Remote tools on Samu's MCP server that call Home Assistant server to server, with a Home Assistant long-lived access token in `deploy/.env`; the phone never talks to Home Assistant directly and needs nothing new. Home Assistant's own MCP server integration is an alternative upstream; check what it exposes before choosing.
- Scope limited to the entities Home Assistant exposes to voice assistants, not the whole instance.
- Confirmation per tool through the server's read-back templates (§4b): status reads are read-only; actions ask by default. Anything security-related (locks, garage, alarm) always asks.
- A `home` skill for phrasing and for asking which room or device when a request is ambiguous.

This supersedes "HA integration" in phase 5's gaps list.

### 5b. Setup and options screen

The setup screen in `MainActivity` doubles as the options screen. Settings live in app-private `SharedPreferences` on the phone (backup is off).

- **Places (built).** Home and work addresses for `navigate`. They never go to the model: it passes "home" or "work", and the phone substitutes the address for the maps app.
- **TTS voice picker (built).** `Speaker.voices()` lists the engine's voices for the current locale that run on the phone: network voices are left out (they'd send everything Samu says, read-backs included, to the engine's servers), as are voices whose data isn't installed and the engine's `-language` alias for its default. Tapping a voice plays a sample and saves its name; each session's `PlatformSpeaker` applies it when the engine is ready, falling back to the engine default with a log line if an engine update renamed or removed it. `Voice` has no gender field and the names are opaque, so rows show "Voice N" with the raw name beneath. Alternative engines (e.g. a Piper-based one) could be selected by passing the package to the `TextToSpeech` constructor; untested.

## 6. Open questions


- **Car use (out of scope for now; phase 5 at the earliest):** the car is used with wired Android Auto, so plain Bluetooth without Android Auto doesn't matter. Research (2026-10-22) says Android Auto's voice entry points don't reach Samu. Sourcing is mixed: the app categories and messaging model come from Google's developer docs; the voice-button behavior comes from press coverage and user reports, and no official doc found states that Android Auto ignores the default assistant role, so the emulator test is the real evidence:
  - Gemini has replaced Google Assistant on Android Auto and is triggered by "Hey Google", the on-screen mic icon, or a long press of the steering-wheel voice button. A test with Alexa as the default assistant found both buttons still opened Google's assistant (older report, nothing since suggests a change). Many cars send a short press of the steering-wheel button to their own built-in assistant instead.
  - Android for Cars accepts only fixed app categories (media, messaging, calling, navigation and others); none is an assistant.
  - The EU interoperability ruling covers the phone (home button, hotword, sensors), not Android Auto, and is EU-only.
  - Android Auto's own message readout now requires Gemini to be on (observed 2026-10-22); with Gemini off, it no longer reads messages. That also rules out the messaging-app workaround (Samu posting answers as a conversation thread for Android Auto to read aloud), which depended on that readout.
  - **To test, not planned:** Samu reading incoming messages aloud itself while the phone is projecting. Detect the Android Auto connection (the Car App Library's connection-state API), then read incoming texts (SMS read permission) or messaging notifications (notification access, below) with the phone's own TTS, which should play through the car speakers like navigation prompts. No trigger and no Gemini needed; read-only, since replying still needs a voice trigger. Unknowns: whether Samu's TTS gets audio focus cleanly during Android Auto, and whether Android 17's background audio rules allow it from the listener (phase 1 showed TTS continuing after the panel closes, a different situation).
  - Confirm with the Android Auto Desktop Head Unit emulator (mic button, steering-wheel long press); expected result is Google's assistant.

- **Search results list (§5a):**
  - Endpoint: `web_search` uses Brave's `llm/context` (extracted text for 8 pages in a 24,000-character budget), which is more than a link list needs. Options: reuse `web_search` and drop the text on the phone; add a mode to it; or a separate remote tool on Brave's plain web search endpoint (titles, snippets, more results, fewer tokens through the server). Check what `llm/context` returns per page (title, snippet) before choosing.
  - Voice follow-ups ("open the second one"): out of scope for the first version; would need the phone to resolve the ordinal against the shown list, not the model.
- **Reminders, timers and alarms (§5a).** Timers and alarms are built and work on the Pixel 8 (2026-10-23); reminders are not:
  - Reminder backend. Android has no system reminder API. Options: (a) a calendar event with a notification, inserted through `CalendarContract` (`WRITE_CALENDAR`, lands in whichever calendar account is chosen, so it syncs off the phone); (b) Samu-owned reminders: `AlarmManager` exact alarm plus a notification (`USE_EXACT_ALARM` or `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`), stored on the phone until they fire and lost on uninstall; (c) a task app with an API (e.g. a self-hosted one as a remote tool). (b) stores the reminder text on disk; that is user-requested data rather than a log, so it doesn't conflict with the memory row, but it should be deleted once the reminder fires or is dismissed.
  - Still to check on the phone: that Google Clock honors `EXTRA_SKIP_UI` for both intents on Android 17 and never brings its own UI over the panel; whether it reuses a matching alarm (same time, days and label) or an unused timer of the same length and label instead of adding one (the `AlarmClock` docs allow either); and that timers set with the UI skipped are removed once dismissed.

  Reminder backend, (a) vs (b):

  | | Calendar event (a) | Samu-owned, phone only (b) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Visible on other devices | Yes, via calendar sync | No |
  | Leaves the phone | Yes, to the calendar provider | No |
  | Survives uninstall or a new phone | Yes | No |
  | Extra permissions | `WRITE_CALENDAR` | Exact alarms, notifications |
  | Stored on the phone | Calendar's job | Reminder text until it fires, then deleted |

  Leaning (b): matches the app's privacy stance, and reminders are mostly short-lived. (a) if reminders should follow to other devices.

- **Music (§5a):**
  - Wanted (2026-10-23): specific requests ("play OK Computer", "play Karma Police") and vague ones ("play some music", "shuffle my library", "play some classical"), at home and away from home Wi-Fi.
  - **Plexamp's play-from-search intent (tested 2026-10-23):** artists work, cold or warm. Albums and tracks don't: Plexamp matches loose title text and ignores the artist and album extras ("OK Computer" played Rammstein's "OK", "Karma Police" played Alicia Keys's "Karma", though both are in the library). When Plexamp's output is a cast target (a Sonos speaker), it opens the last playlist paused and ignores the search.
  - **Plexamp's media browser service (tested 2026-10-23):** closed. `PlexampPlayerService` is exported, but its `onGetRoot` returns no root for Samu (a caller allowlist), so no browsing, search or play-by-ID.
  - **Media keys (tested 2026-10-23):** Plexamp holds the media button session whenever it plays on the phone, so `media_control` through `AudioManager.dispatchMediaKeyEvent` reaches it. Untested while it casts.
  - **Plex Media Server API (tested 2026-10-23, from the workstation with a dedicated "Samu" device token from plex.tv's PIN flow, kept in `deploy/.env`):** `/hubs/search` is exact for albums, tracks and artists; `/playQueues` builds an album or track queue, a library shuffle (`/library/sections/<music>/all?type=10`, `shuffle=1`) or a genre queue (track `genre=`, or `album.genre=` / `artist.genre=` for broader results). Genre results are only as good as the library's tags ("Classical" is mostly film scores). The server only accepts TLS on its port (it serves its own certificate even with secure connections not configured).
  - **Starting playback on the phone's Plexamp:** on home Wi-Fi, a `playMedia` command through the server (`/player/playback/playMedia` with `X-Plex-Target-Client-Identifier`) plays the queue, and pause works the same way; so does a direct call to Plexamp's companion port. With the phone on cellular every route failed: the server returns 500, the phone's public address is unreachable, and Plexamp stops listening on its companion port (even on loopback). plex.tv lists Plexamp as a `pubsub-player`, which suggests a plex.tv messaging channel, but nothing public documents it.
  - **Plex's own apps can't either (2026-10-23):** with the phone on cellular, neither Plexamp desktop nor Plex Web lists the phone's Plexamp as a player. Remote control off the home network isn't available at all, so the Plexamp route would be home-only.
  - **Symfonium (tested 2026-10-23, all on cellular, signed in to the Plex server):** its broadcast API (`app.symfonium.api.MEDIA_START`, `MEDIA_COMMAND`, `SELECT_RENDERER`, receiver `app.symfonium.remote.api.ApiReceiver`) played the exact album and song by name plus artist, an artist, a shuffled genre, and song and album mixes; next, pause, play and volume work, as do media keys. Names match case-insensitively but exactly: a misspelled or unknown name does nothing and reports nothing. Selecting a Sonos group (`TYPE` 1, UPnP) cast to it, and volume then followed the speaker. Renderer IDs: Sonos = group coordinator UUID + `_MR`; Google Cast = the device's mDNS `id`. Chosen (§2 decisions).
  - **Checked on the phone (2026-10-23):** speaker discovery needs `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` (a runtime permission on Android 17); without it, `NsdManager` shows a system device picker instead of discovering. A 1.5 s pause between selecting a speaker and starting playback is enough. Volume up and down reach a speaker while casting. The panel holds transient audio focus so music on the phone pauses while Samu listens; "pause" ends the session with a permanent focus loss so the player doesn't resume. A speaker keeps playing while Samu listens (focus is phone-local); accepted, since pausing it would need notification access to know whether it was playing.
  - "What's playing?": with Plex, the server's current sessions list answers it, so the phone needs no notification access. Without Plex the only general route is notification access (a `NotificationListenerService`, which also grants reading every notification); not worth it for one question alone, but see the notification access item below, which would provide it.
- **Notification access (candidate feature, 2026-10-22):** a `NotificationListenerService` the user enables in settings, for messages and email from apps with no API of their own (Signal, Proton Mail).
  - Uses: read incoming notifications aloud ("any new messages?"); dismiss them; trigger the notification's own actions. Signal's notifications normally carry Reply (inline, via `RemoteInput`) and Mark read, so Samu could answer a Signal message that's still in the shade, though not start a new conversation (partial answer to the Signal constraint in §3). Proton Mail's actions are whatever its notifications carry (unverified; possibly archive, trash, mark read). What Proton shows at all depends on its notification content setting.
  - SMS doesn't need this: `READ_SMS` reads texts directly and more reliably.
  - Android 15+ hides sensitive content such as one-time codes from untrusted listeners, so OTPs likely won't reach Samu.
  - Safety: notification text is outside content (anyone can send an email), so reading one sets the same session flag as web search (calls ask first, §2). A reply sends a message, so it always asks, with recipient and body read back from the notification's own data and the resolved arguments, never the model's text.
  - Privacy: reading a notification through the LLM sends its text to Anthropic via the gateway and possibly into the gateway's body logs. Preferred design: the phone reads sender and subject or preview aloud locally, with no model call, and the model sees a notification only when the user asks to act on it. Anthropic API data isn't used for training by default; retention is short but non-zero, and zero data retention is an enterprise arrangement, not a setting.
  - Also provides "what's playing" from media sessions, independent of Plex (music item above).
- **Notes and shared memory via Constellation:** Samu reading and writing notes that other agents (claude.ai, Claude Code) can also use, with Constellation as the storage backend: plain files on a share, Obsidian-vault style, rather than a memory system of its own. Part of a separate memory project whose design isn't settled (including whether Constellation is the backend); Samu should follow it, not define it. Points so far:
  - Path: preferred is a narrow remote tool on Samu's MCP server (e.g. `add_note`, maybe `read_notes`) that calls Constellation server to server, so the phone keeps one MCP endpoint, one token audience, and the minimal client. Needs a Constellation credential on Samu's server scoped to one notes share; an exception to pass-through auth, acceptable for a single-user service. Alternative: the phone talks to Constellation's MCP directly, which adds a second audience and may need `initialize`/sessions (unchecked), breaking the stateless-client assumption (§2, MCP client row).
  - Surface: never expose Constellation's general file tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `move`, `delete`) to the phone's model, which reads web content. Append-style writes only; reads limited to the notes share.
  - Confirmation: a write is a remote action tool, so it asks by default; it needs a server read-back template (§4b) so the note text is read back from the actual arguments.
  - Fits the memory row: notes are user-requested data, not a log of sessions.
  - Swap point: the tool name and skill stay the same if the backend later changes (e.g. to a structured memory engine).
  - The same path could carry reminders (option c above) if a synced backend is wanted.
- **Getting back to a session after opening a page:** tapping a result or a sources-pill page closes the panel, which discards the session (memory row, §2), so going back to try a different result means searching again. Undecided. A short window fits the memory decision's intent (no persistent record, memory only), provided the state is never written to disk: not to preferences or files, and not to saved-state bundles that Android may persist. Losing it on process death is acceptable. Candidates:
  - *Resume window:* closing hides the session and keeps it in memory for a short time (a few minutes); invoking again within it restores the conversation, results list included. Covers follow-up questions too.
  - *Results-only persistence:* only the last results list survives the window; invoking again shows it to tap a different result. Narrower, matches the search use case.
  - Either way, the "session has read outside content" flag (calls ask first, §2) must survive a resume, so a page just visited can't feed an announced call.
  - Not wanted: Custom Tabs with back returning to the panel.

(Resolved: web search, now our own tool, and the MCP client on the phone; see the decisions table.) New questions get added here as they come up.

## 7. Risks

- **Battery** if a wake word is ever added. Mitigation: keep it optional and off by default.
- **Endpoint availability.** If the server, gateway, or Authentik is down, the assistant is down. v1 fails cleanly; fallback endpoint is v.next.
- **Public exposure.** The auth gateway is internet-facing. Keep it minimal, expose only the needed routes, rate-limit; Bifrost budget caps bound the worst case.
- **Misfired actions.** Wrong contact or a misheard message body. Mitigated by the confirmation policy (§2) and asking back on ambiguous matches.
- **Bifrost maturity / vendor.** Single-vendor open-core project; most documentation and comparisons come from the vendor. Mitigated by the replaceable-unit design.
- **Latency.** Two hops add round-trip time; likely small next to LLM latency, but measure in phase 2.
- **AccessibilityService fragility** — breaks when apps change UI. Keep it out of the core path.
- **Policy drift** — Google could change role behavior or Gemini integration in future Android releases. The DMA ruling cuts the other way in the EU; US is unknown.
