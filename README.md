<p align="center"><em>Samu by Mahasamuha</em><br>A personal voice assistant for Android</p>

Samu replaces Google Assistant on one Pixel phone. The app holds the default assistant role, so a long-press of the power button opens its panel. It listens on the phone, sends the question to a hosted LLM (Anthropic's Claude) through a small self-hosted gateway, and speaks the answer on the phone.

It's built for one user and one device. The design and the reasoning behind each decision are in [`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md).

## What it does

| Ask | What happens |
|---|---|
| "How many grams in a cup of sugar?" | Answered by the model. |
| "What did the Dow do today?" | Web search (Brave Search API), answered in a sentence or two, with source links in the panel. |
| "Will it rain this weekend?" / "Any weather alerts?" | Weather from Pirate Weather, with Open-Meteo on the phone as a fallback. |
| "Call Sam Lee" | Looks up the contact on the phone and places the call: announced when the match is certain, confirmed first when it isn't. |
| "Text Sam I'm running late" | Reads back the recipient and message and sends only after a yes. |
| "Navigate to Costco" / "Navigate home with Google Maps" / "Navigate to Mom's" | Opens Waze (default) or Google Maps with turn-by-turn directions. |
| "Set a timer for 10 minutes" / "Wake me up at 6:30" / "Alarm at 7 on weekdays" | Sets it in the Clock app straight away and says so ("Alarm, 6:30 AM tomorrow"). A missing AM or PM is inferred when it's obvious, and asked when it isn't. |
| "Play OK Computer" / "Play some music" / "Play some jazz in the office" | Plays from your own music library in [Symfonium](https://symfonium.app), on the phone or on a Sonos or Google Cast speaker. |
| "Pause" / "Skip" / "Turn it up" / "Move this to the phone" | Controls the music, including moving what's playing between the phone and a speaker. |

Misheard contact names get a "did you mean…" from a sound-alike search on the phone. If location is off when navigating, a one-tap dialog turns it on first. Music names are looked up in the Plex library first, so a near miss gets a "did you mean…" too, and music on the phone pauses while Samu listens.

## How it works

```
phone ──HTTPS + token──▶ auth gateway ──┬─ /v1/responses ─▶ Bifrost ──▶ Anthropic
  │                     (public)        └─ /mcp ──────────▶ MCP server ──▶ Brave Search, Pirate Weather, Plex
  │                                        (private network: Bifrost and the MCP server aren't reachable from outside)
  └─ on the phone: speech recognition, text-to-speech, the tool loop, contacts, calls, texts, navigation,
     timers and alarms (Clock app), music (Symfonium), speaker discovery on home Wi-Fi
```

- **Phone app** (`app/`, Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Android 17). A `VoiceInteractionService` holding the assistant role. It signs in once with OAuth (authorization code + PKCE) and keeps the refresh token encrypted under a hardware-backed Keystore key. It runs the tool loop: tool calls from the model run on the phone, or on the MCP server for tools that need a server-side key.
- **Auth gateway** (`gateway/`, TypeScript). The only public piece. It validates the identity provider's JWT, rate-limits per user, adds the Bifrost virtual key, and streams responses straight through. Anything outside its three routes (`POST /v1/responses`, `POST /mcp`, `GET /healthz`) is a 404.
- **Bifrost** ([getbifrost.ai](https://www.getbifrost.ai)). An LLM gateway on the private network that holds the provider key and enforces a monthly budget and a model allowlist.
- **MCP server** (`mcp/`, TypeScript). Stateless remote tools, reached only through the gateway: `web_search`, `get_weather`, and `music_find`, which looks up exact names in the Plex music library for the phone's music tool (the model never calls it directly).
- **Music player.** Symfonium (a paid Android player, not part of this repo) plays the library from the Plex server. Samu drives it through its broadcast API on the phone, so music works on any network; casting to a speaker needs home Wi-Fi.
- **Skills** (`skills/`). Short instruction bundles in the `SKILL.md` format that teach the model each task, such as calling or navigation. They're bundled into the app.

## Privacy and safety

- **No provider keys on the phone.** It holds only the identity provider's URL, a client ID and the gateway's URL. Keys live on the server.
- **Speech stays on the phone.** Recognition must be on-device: if it isn't available, Samu says so rather than falling back to a cloud recognizer. The voice picker lists only on-device voices.
- **Contacts stay on the phone.** Only the matched names and numbers go to the model. Home, work and contact addresses never go to the model: it says "home" or a contact's name, and the phone fills in the address for the maps app.
- **Location** is shared only at city level, for local answers.
- **Music and speakers.** Only the requested names reach the server's library lookup, and the Plex token stays on the server. Speakers are found on the local network by the phone; the model sees only their names, never their IDs or addresses.
- **Side effects are enforced in code, not by the prompt.** Texts are always read back and need a yes. Calls are announced when the contact is certain and confirmed otherwise. Timers, alarms and music controls are harmless and easy to undo, so they happen at once and Samu says what it did. After a session has read outside content (web search, weather), calls and navigation ask first, so text from a web page can't start an action on its own. Numbers must be plain digits, so star codes like call forwarding are refused.
- **Samu talks to the LLM only while the phone is unlocked.**
- **Logs:** the gateway can keep request and response bodies for debugging, with a retention limit, and the deployed configuration turns it off. Bifrost keeps cost and usage, not content.

## Repository layout

```
app/       Android app (Gradle, Kotlin DSL)
gateway/   Auth gateway (Node, pnpm)
mcp/       MCP server for remote tools (Node, pnpm)
deploy/    Docker Compose for the gateway, Bifrost and the MCP server; env templates
skills/    SKILL.md instruction bundles
docs/      The plan, identity provider setup, and findings from each phase
```

Each directory builds on its own; there's no monorepo tooling.

## Setting it up

1. **Identity provider.** Create a public OAuth client with PKCE and its own audience. The steps for Authentik are in [`docs/authentik-setup.md`](docs/authentik-setup.md).
2. **Server.** The gateway and MCP server images are published to Docker Hub (`mahasamuha/samu-gateway`, `mahasamuha/samu-mcp`) by GitHub Actions. On the server you need only `deploy/` and its env files. Then run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` behind a reverse proxy. The details, including Bifrost's configuration and budget, are in [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).
3. **App.** Copy `app/config.example.properties` to `app/config.local.properties`, fill in the issuer, client ID and gateway URL, then build with `./gradlew assembleDebug` in `app/` and install with `adb install`. Open Samu, sign in, set it as the digital assistant, and grant the permissions on its setup screen. The setup screen is also where you set home and work addresses, pick a voice, and allow local network access for speakers.
4. **Music (optional).** Install Symfonium and sign it in to your Plex server. For the library lookup, add `PLEX_URL`, `PLEX_TOKEN` and `PLEX_TLS_NAME` to the server's `deploy/.env` (see [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md)); without them, names go to Symfonium as spoken.

Real hosts, keys and IDs live only in gitignored files (`.env`, `deploy/local/`, `app/config.local.properties`); the repository holds templates with placeholders.

## Status

Phases 1–3 of the plan are done: invocation, the voice round trip, and tools and skills, including the MCP server. Since then: navigation, timers and alarms, and music. The server side is deployed, and Samu is in daily use. Phase 4, sending on-screen context to the model, waits until there's a real need for it. Findings from each phase are in `docs/phase*-notes.md`.
